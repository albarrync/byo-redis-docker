Build Your Own - Redis
[BYO Redis](https://build-your-own.org/redis/)

This is an attempt to use the Build Your Own ecosystem and connect the services through docker.
This is the first stop.

The current plan is to use any redis function on the Docker container, and any client service from my M2 Mac.
